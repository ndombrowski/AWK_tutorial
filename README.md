# AWK_tutorial

This tutorial introduces into some basics in working with AWK and the full tutorial is rendered and provided as HTML [here](https://ndombrowski.github.io/AWK_tutorial/).

With this folder the raw rmd file as well as some example files are provided to test the code on your own computer.

AWK is an excellent tool to filter and manipulate data that comes with rows and columns, which is very common with biological data. 
Awk requires no compiling, and allows the user to use variables, numeric functions, string functions, and logical operators.
Importantly, it can deal fast and effectively with very large data files.

Examples of things AWK can do (and what we will learn here):

- Subset dataframes by columns
- Subset dataframes based on patterns
- Merge dataframes
- etc.
